*Gizmo disclaimer: All gizmos are on a they-work-on-my-machine basis. These are hacks I've thrown together to make my life easier or to serve some small purpose where there exists no better tool. If this works for you, awesome! I hope you love it. If this doesn't work, hopefully it is useful as a reference or starting point :).*
